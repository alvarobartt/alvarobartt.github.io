Hi, I'm Alvaro Bartolome (alvarobartt online) a Machine Learning Engineer currently working 
at [Argilla](https://argilla.io), an open-source data curation platform for NLP.

My main area of research is NLP, while I also like exploring CV. I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects, and also work on my own open-source projects. If you're interested in my work, please check out the [projects](https://alvarobartt.github.io/projects.html) tab.

I also enjoy traveling, reading, playing/watching basketball, practicing jiu-jitsu, and watching MMA.
