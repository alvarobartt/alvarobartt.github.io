Hi, I'm Alvaro Bartolome (@alvarobartt online) a Machine Learning Engineer currently working 
for [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org), where I work with both NLP and CV, as well as
MLOps (deployment, monitoring, etc.).

My main interests in ML are both NLP and CV, lately mainly NLP. I also like to contribute
to open source both as a collaborator and as a developer with my projects. If you're interested
in my project please check out the [projects] tab.

I also enjoy traveling, reading, playing/watching basketball, practicing jiu-jitsu, and watching MMA.
